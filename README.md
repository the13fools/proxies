# proxies
Making some proxy scripts I found on the internet avalible on github.

I needed to setup a proxy server, and it took a bit of looking to track down one which was easy to deploy.  
Putting this here in case the reference, ended up initializing a LAMP instance on digital ocean and installing glype.
